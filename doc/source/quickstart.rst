diffpy.morph Quickstart Tutorial
################################

Welcome! This will be a quick tutorial to accquaint users with ``diffpy.morph``
and some of what it can do on the command-line.
Tutorials for more advanced features can be found on the `tutorials page <tutorials.html>`__.
For those wishing to integrate ``diffpy.morph`` into their Python scripts,
see the `morphpy tutorial <morphpy.html>`__.

To see more details and definitions about
the morphs please see the publication describing ``diffpy.morph``.

As we described in the README and installation instructions, please make
sure that you are familiar with working with your command line terminal
before using this application.

Before you've started this tutorial, please ensure that you've installed
all necessary software and dependencies.

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to use ``diffpy.morph`` to compare
two
PDFs measured from the same material at different temperatures.
The morphs showcased include "stretch", "scale", and "smear".

Basic diffpy.morph Workflow
===========================

    1. Open your Terminal or Command Prompt.

    2. If it's not active already, activate your diffpy.morph-equipped
       conda environment by typing in ::

           conda activate <diffpy_morph_env>


       * If you need to list your available conda environments,
         run the command ``conda info --envs`` or
         ``conda env list``

       * Run the ``diffpy.morph --help`` command and read over the
         info on that page for a brief overview of some of what we will
         explore in this tutorial.

    3. Using the ``mkdir`` command, create a directory where you'll
       store the tutorial PDF files and use the ``cd`` command to change
       into that directory. You can download the tutorial files
       :download:`here <../../tutorial/quickstartData.zip>`.
       Then, ``cd`` into the ``quickstartData`` directory.

       * The files in this dataset were collected by Soham Banerjee
         at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York.

       * The files are PDF data collected on Iridium Telluride with
         20% Rhodium Doping (IrRhTe2) with the first file (01) collected
         at 10K and the last (44) at 300K. The samples increase in
         temperature as their numbers increase. The "C" in their names
         indicates that they have undergone cooling.

       * Note that these files have the ``.gr`` extension, which
         indicates that they are measured PDFs. The ``.cgr`` file
         extension indicates that a file is a calculated PDF, such as
         those generated by the
	 `PDFgui <https://www.diffpy.org/products/pdfgui.html>`_
         program.

    4. First, we will run the ``diffpy.morph`` application without any morphing
       and only using one PDF. Type the following command into your
       command line ::

           diffpy.morph darkSub_rh20_C_01.gr darkSub_rh20_C_01.gr

       This should produce two PDF curves which are congruent, resulting
       in a flat green line underneath them.

    5. Now, we will see ``diffpy.morph`` run with two different PDFs and no
       morphing. Type the following command into your command line ::

           diffpy.morph darkSub_rh20_C_01.gr darkSub_rh20_C_44.gr

       Without morphing, the difference Rw = 0.407. This indicates that
       the two PDFs vary drastically.

       * While running the ``diffpy.morph`` command, it is important
         to remember that the first PDF file argument you provide
         (in this case, ``darkSub_rh20_C_01.gr``) is the PDF which
         will get morphed, while the second PDF file argument you
         provide (here, ``darkSub_rh20_C_44.gr``) is the PDF which
         acts as the model and does not get morphed. Hereinafter,
         we will refer to the first PDF argument as the "morph"
         and the second as the "target", as the ``diffpy.morph`` display
         does.

       Using ``diffpy.morph`` to compare two different PDFs without morphing.

    6. Now, we will start the morphing process, which requires us to
       provide initial guesses for our scaling factor, Gaussian smear,
       and stretch, separately. We will start with the scaling factor.
       Begin by typing the command ::

           diffpy.morph --scale=2 -a darkSub_rh20_C_01.gr darkSub_rh20_C_44.gr

       Now, the difference Rw = 1.457, a significant increase from our
       value previously. We must modify our initial value for the
       scaling factor and do so until we see a reduction in the
       difference Rw from the unmorphed value. Type ::

           diffpy.morph --scale=0.9 -a darkSub_rh20_C_01.gr darkSub_rh20_C_44.gr

       The difference Rw is now 0.351, lower than our unmorphed
       example's value. To see ``diffpy.morph`` optimize the scale factor,
       simply drop ``-a`` from the command and type ::

           diffpy.morph --scale=0.9 darkSub_rh20_C_01.gr darkSub_rh20_C_44.gr

       ``diffpy.morph``, given a reasonable initial guess, will use find the
       optimal value for each morphing feature. Here, we see that
       ``diffpy.morph`` displays ``scale = 0.799025`` in the command prompt,
       meaning that it has found this to be the most optimal value for
       the scale factor. The difference Rw = 0.330, indicating a
       better fit than our reasonable initial guess.

       * It is the choice of the user whether or not to run values
         before removing ``-a`` when analyzing data with ``diffpy.morph``.
         By including it, you allow the possibility to move towards
         convergence before allowing the program to optimize by
         removing it; when including it, you may reach a highly
         optimized value on the first guess or diverge greatly.
         In this tutorial, we will use it every time to check
         for convergence.

    .. figure:: images/qs_tutorial_scaled.png
       :align: center
       :figwidth: 100%

       ``diffpy.morph`` found an optimal value for the scale factor.

    7. Now, we will examine the Gaussian smearing factor. We provide an
       initial guess by typing ::

           diffpy.morph --scale=0.8 --smear=0.5 -a darkSub_rh20_C_01.gr darkSub_rh20_C_44.gr

       And viewing the results. We've tailored our scale factor to be
       close to the value given by ``diffpy.morph``, but see that the difference
       Rw has increased substantially due to our smear value. One
       approach, as described above, is to remove the ``-a`` from the
       above command and run it again.

       * Note: The warnings that the Terminal/Command Prompt
         displays are largely numerical in nature and do not
         indicate a physically irrelevant guess. These are somewhat
         superficial and in most cases can be ignored.

       We see that this has had hardly any effect on our PDF. To see
       an effect, we restrict the ``rmin`` and ``rmax`` values to
       reflect relevant data range by typing ::

           diffpy.morph --scale=0.8 --smear=0.5 --rmin=1.5 --rmax=30 darkSub_rh20_C_01.gr darkSub_rh20_C_44.gr

       Now, we see that the difference Rw = 0.204 and that the optimized
       ``smear=-0.084138``.

       * We restricted the r values because some of the Gaussian
         smear effects are only visible in a fixed r range. We
         chose this r range by noting where most of our relevant
         data was that was not exponentially decayed by
         instrumental shortcomings.

    We are getting closer to an acceptably close fit to our data!

    8. Finally, we will examine the stretch factor. Provide an initial
       guess by typing ::

           diffpy.morph --scale=0.8 --smear=-0.08 --stretch=0.5 --rmin=1.5 --rmax=30 -a darkSub_rh20_C_01.gr darkSub_rh20_C_44.gr

       And noting that the difference has increased. Before continuing,
       see if you can see which direction (higher or lower) our initial
       estimate for the stretch factor needs to go and then removing
       the ``-a`` to check optimized value!

       If you cannot, type ::

           diffpy.morph --scale=0.8 --smear=-0.08 --stretch=0.005 --rmin=1.5 --rmax=30 -a darkSub_rh20_C_01.gr darkSub_rh20_C_44.gr

       to observe decreased difference and then remove ``-a`` to see
       the optimized ``--stretch=0.001762``. We have now reached
       the optimal fit for our PDF!

    .. figure:: images/qs_tutorial_morphed.png
       :align: center
       :figwidth: 100%

       The optimal fit after applying the scale, smear, and stretch morphs.

    9. Now, try it on your own! If you have personally collected or
       otherwise readily available PDF data, try this process to see if
       you can morph your PDFs to one another. Many of the parameters
       provided in this tutorial are unique to it, so be cautious about
       your choices and made sure that they remain physically relevant.

Enjoy the software!
