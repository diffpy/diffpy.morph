Introduction
++++++++++++

``PDFmorph`` is a Python package that increases the insight 
researchers can obtain from measured atomic pair distribution functions 
(PDFs) in a model-independent way. It was designed to help a 
researcher answer the question: "Has my material undergone a phase 
transition between these two measurements?"

One approach is to compare the two PDFs in a plot and view the 
difference curve underneath. However, significant signal can be seen in 
the difference curve from benign effects such as thermal expansion (peak 
shifts) and increased thermal motion (peak broadening) or a change in 
scale due to differences in incident flux, for example. ``PDFmorph`` will 
do its best to correct for these benign effects before computing and 
plotting the difference curve. One measured PDF (typically that 
collected under higher temperature) is identified as the target PDF and 
the second PDF is then morphed by "stretching" (changing the r-axis to
simulate a uniform lattice expansion), "smearing" (broadening peaks 
through a uniform convolution to simulate increased thermal motion), and 
"scaling" (self-explanatory). PDFmorph will vary the amplitude of the 
morphing transformations to obtain the best fit between the morphed and 
the target PDFs, then plot them on top of each other with the difference 
plotted below.

There are also a few other morphing transformations in the program.
If no morphing transformation is specified, ``PDFmorph`` will return just
the plotted PDFs.

Finally, we note that though ``PDFmorph`` should work on other spectra 
that are not PDFs, it has not been extensively tested beyond the PDF.
