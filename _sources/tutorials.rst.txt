Performing Multiple Morphs
==========================

It may be useful to morph a PDF against multiple targets:
for example, you may want to morph a PDF against multiple PDFs measured
at various temperatures to determine whether a phase change has occurred.
``diffpy.morph`` currently allows users to morph a PDF against all files in a
selected directory and plot resulting :math:`R_w` values from each morph.

1. Within the ``additionalData`` directory, ``cd`` into the
   ``morphsequence`` directory. Inside, you will find multiple PDFs of
   :math:`SrFe_2As_2` measured at various temperatures. These PDFs are
   from `"Atomic Pair Distribution Function Analysis: A primer"
   <https://global.oup.com/academic/product/
   atomic-pair-distribution-function-analysis-9780198885801>`_.

2. Let us start by getting the :math:`R_w` of ``SrFe2As2_150K.gr`` compared to
   all other files in the directory. Run ::

       diffpy.morph SrFe2As2_150K.gr . --multiple-targets

   The multiple tag indicates we are comparing PDF file (first input)
   against all PDFs in a directory (second input). Our choice of file
   was ``SeFe2As2_150K.gr`` and directory was the cwd, which should be
   ``morphsequence``.

.. figure:: images/ex_tutorial_bar.png
   :align: center
   :figwidth: 100%

   Bar chart of :math:`R_W` values for each target file. Target files are
   listed in ASCII sort order.

3. After running this, we get chart of :math:`R_w` values for each target file.
   However, this chart can be a bit confusing to interpret. To get a
   more understandable plot, run ::

       diffpy.morph SrFe2As2_150K.gr . --multiple-targets --sort-by=temperature

   This plots the :math:`R_w` against the temperature parameter value provided
   at the top of each file. Parameters are entries of the form
   ``<parameter_name> = <parameter_value>`` and are located above
   the ``r`` versus ``gr`` table in each PDF file. ::

     # SrFe2As2_150K.gr
     [PDF Parameters]
     temperature = 150
     wavelength = 0.1
     ...

.. figure:: images/ex_tutorial_temp.png
   :align: center
   :figwidth: 100%

   The :math:`R_W` plotted against the temperature the target PDF was
   measured at.

4. Between 192K and 198K, the Rw has a sharp increase, indicating that
   we may have a phase change. To confirm, let us now apply morphs
   onto `` SrFe2As2_150K.gr`` with all other files in
   ``morphsequence`` as targets ::

       diffpy.morph --scale=1 --stretch=0 SrFe2As2_150K.gr . --multiple-targets --sort-by=temperature

   Note that we are not applying a smear since it takes a long time to
   apply and does not significantly change the Rw values in this example.

5. We should now see a sharper increase in :math:`R_w` between 192K and 198K.

6. Go back to the terminal to see optimized morphing parameters from each morph.

7. On the morph with ``SrFe2As2_192K.gr`` as target, ``scale =
   0.972085`` and ``stretch = 0.000508`` and with ``SrFe2As2_198K.gr``
   as target, ``scale = 0.970276`` and ``stretch = 0.000510``. These
   are very similar, meaning that thermal lattice expansion (accounted
   for by ``stretch``) is not occurring. This, coupled with the fact
   that the Rw significantly increases suggests a phase change in this
   temperature regime. (In fact, :math:`SrFe_2As_2` does transition
   from orthorhombic at lower temperature to tetragonal at higher
   temperature!). More sophisticated analysis can be done with
   `PDFgui <https://www.diffpy.org/products/pdfgui.html>`_.

8. Finally, let us save all the morphed PDFs into a directory
   named ``saved-morphs``. ::

     diffpy.morph SrFe2As2_150K.gr . --scale=1 --stretch=0 --multiple-targets \
     --sort-by=temperature --plot-parameter=stretch \
     --save=saved-morphs

   Entering the directory with ``cd`` and viewing its contents with
   ``ls``, we see a file named ``morph-reference-table.txt`` with data
   about the input morph parameters and re- fined output parameters
   and a directory named ``morphs`` containing all the morphed
   PDFs. See the ``--save-names-file`` option to see how you can set
   the names for these saved morphs!

Polynomial Squeeze Morph
=========================

Another advanced feature in ``diffpy.morph`` is the ``MorphSqueeze`` morph,
which applies a user-defined polynomial to squeeze the morph function along the
x-axis. This provides a flexible way to correct for higher-order distortions
that simple shift or stretch morphs cannot fully address.
Such distortions can arise from geometric artifacts in X-ray detector modules,
including tilts, curved detection planes, or angle-dependent offsets, as well
as from intrinsic structural effects in the sample.

A first-order squeeze polynomial recovers the behavior of simple shift or stretch,
while higher-order terms enable non-linear corrections. The squeeze transformation
is defined as:

.. math::

   \Delta r(r) = a_0 + a_1 r + a_2 r^2 + \dots + a_n r^n

where :math:`a_0, a_1, ..., a_n` are the polynomial coefficients defined by the user.

In this example, we show how to apply a squeeze morph in combination
with a scale morph to match a morph function to its target. The required
files can be found in ``additionalData/morphsqueeze/``.

1. ``cd`` into the ``morphsqueeze`` directory::

       cd additionalData/morphsqueeze

   Here you will find:

   - ``squeeze_morph.cgr`` — the morph function with a small built-in polynomial distortion.
   - ``squeeze_target.cgr`` — the target function.

2. Suppose we know that the morph needs a quadratic and cubic squeeze,
   plus a scale factor to best match the target. As an initial guess,
   we can use:

   - ``squeeze = 0,-0.001,-0.0001,0.0001``
     (for a polynomial: :math:`a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3`)
   - ``scale = 1.1``

   The squeeze polynomial is provided as a comma-separated list (no spaces)::

       diffpy.morph --scale=1.1 --squeeze=0,-0.001,-0.0001,0.0001 -a squeeze_morph.cgr squeeze_target.cgr

3. ``diffpy.morph`` will apply the polynomial squeeze and scale,
   display the initial and refined coefficients, and show the final
   difference ``Rw``.

   To refine the squeeze polynomial and scale automatically, remove
   the ``-a`` tag if you used it. For example::

       diffpy.morph --scale=1.1 --squeeze=0,-0.001,-0.0001,0.0001 squeeze_morph.cgr squeeze_target.cgr

4. Check the output for the final squeeze polynomial coefficients and scale.
   They should match the true values used to generate the test data:

   - ``squeeze = 0, 0.01, 0.0001, 0.001``
   - ``scale = 0.5``

   ``diffpy.morph`` refines the coefficients to minimize the residual
   between the squeezed, scaled morph function and the target.

.. warning::

   **Extrapolation risk:**
   A polynomial squeeze can shift morph data outside the target’s ``r``-range,
   so parts of the output may be extrapolated.
   This is generally fine if the polynomial coefficients are small and
   the distortion is therefore small. If your coefficients are large, check the
   plots carefully — strong extrapolation can produce unrealistic features at
   the edges. If needed, adjust the coefficients to keep the morph physically
   meaningful.

Experiment with your own squeeze polynomials to fine-tune your morphs — even
small higher-order corrections can make a big difference!

Nanoparticle Shape Effects
==========================

A nanoparticle's finite size and shape can affect the shape of its PDF.
We can use ``diffpy.morph`` to morph a bulk material PDF to simulate these shape effects.
Currently, the supported nanoparticle shapes include: spheres and spheroids.

* Within the ``additionalData`` directory, ``cd`` into the
  ``morphShape`` subdirectory. Inside, you will find a sample Ni bulk
  material PDF ``Ni_bulk.gr``. This PDF is from `"Atomic Pair
  Distribution Function Analysis:
  A primer" <https://global.oup.com/academic/product/
   atomic-pair-distribution-function-analysis-9780198885801>`_.
  There are also multiple ``.cgr`` files with calculated Ni nanoparticle PDFs.

* Let us apply various shape effect morphs on the bulk material to
  reproduce these calculated PDFs.

    * Spherical Shape
        1. The ``Ni_nano_sphere.cgr`` file contains a generated
	   spherical nanoparticle with unknown radius. First, let us
	   plot ``Ni_blk.gr`` against ``Ni_nano_sphere.cgr`` ::

               diffpy.morph Ni_bulk.gr Ni_nano_sphere.cgr

           Despite the two being the same material, the Rw is quite large.
           To reduce the Rw, we will apply spherical shape effects onto the PDF.
           However, in order to do so, we first need the radius of the
	   spherical nanoparticle.

        2. To get the radius, we can first observe a plot of
	   ``Ni_nano_sphere.cgr`` ::

               diffpy.morph Ni_nano_sphere.cgr Ni_nano_sphere.cgr

           Nanoparticles tend to have broader peaks at r-values larger
	   than the particle size, corresponding to the much weaker
	   correlations between molecules. On our plot, beyond r=22.5,
	   peaks are too broad to be visible, indicating our particle
	   size to be about 22.4. The approximate radius of a sphere
	   would be half of that, or 11.2.


        3. Now, we are ready to perform a morph applying spherical
	   effects. To do so, we use the ``--radius`` parameter ::

               diffpy.morph Ni_bulk.gr Ni_nano_sphere.cgr --radius=11.2 -a --rmax=30

        4. We can see that the :math:`Rw` value has significantly decreased
	   from before. Run without the ``-a`` tag to refine ::

               diffpy.morph Ni_bulk.gr Ni_nano_sphere.cgr --radius=11.2 --rmax=30

        5. After refining, we see the actual radius of the
	   nanoparticle was closer to 12.

    * Spheroidal Shape

        1. The ``Ni_nano_spheroid.cgr`` file contains a calculated
	   spheroidal Ni nanoparticle. Again, we can begin by plotting
	   the bulk material against our nanoparticle ::

               diffpy.morph Ni_bulk.gr Ni_nano_spheroid.cgr

        2. Inside the ``Ni_nano_spheroid.cgr`` file, we are given that
	   the equatorial radius is 12 and polar radius is 6. This is
	   enough information to define our spheroid. To apply
	   spheroid shape effects onto our bulk, run ::

               diffpy.morph Ni_bulk.gr Ni_nano_spheroid.cgr --radius=12 --pradius=6 -a --rmax=30

           Note that the equatorial radius corresponds to the
	   ``--radius`` parameter and polar radius to ``--pradius``.

        3. Remove the ``-a`` tag to refine.

There is also support for morphing from a nanoparticle to a bulk. When
applying the inverse morphs, it is recommended to set ``--rmax=psize``
where ``psize`` is the longest diameter of the nanoparticle.
